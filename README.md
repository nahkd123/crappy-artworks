# nahkd's crappy artworks
_A collection of my crappy artworks (at least in my opinion). No I'm not proud of myself._

According to Bing (oh my god), I should keep track of my past works, so this repository is where I store my art stuffs.

If you have an advice, message or whatever, please open a new issue in [Issues tab](https://github.com/nahkd123/crappy-artworks/issues).

And if you can't tell, yes I'm pretty much a beginner at drawing stuffs. There're a lot of things to learn, but I'm just too busy working on other projects.

## Directories
- ``paper-and-pen/``: A collection of artworks drawn on papers.

## License
All artworks in this repository are licensed under CC0 1.0 Universal. Attribution is **not** required, but you can't claim those as your works either ðŸ¤¡ (according to Bing again).

### Why CC0?
I think forcing someone to give credits for crappy artworks is just kinda stupid. Of course, I would license a decent one with other Creative Commons licenses.

## Special thanks
- "Termux the terminal emulator and the 'system'" contributors for awesome tool. Without them, I wouldn't be able to push my images to GitHub (or I can drop my files to my PC, but ehhh... whatever I guess).
