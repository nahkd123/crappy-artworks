# nahkd's crappy artworks
_A collection of my crappy artworks (at least in my opinion). No I'm not proud of myself._

According to Bing (oh my god), I should keep track of my past works, so this repository is where I store my art stuffs.

If you have an advice, message or whatever, please open a new issue in [Issues tab](https://github.com/nahkd123/crappy-artworks/issues).

## License
All artworks in this repository are licensed under CC0 1.0 Universal. Attribution is **not** required, but you can't claim those as your works either ðŸ¤¡ (according to Bing again).

This ``README.md`` is licensed under WTFPL because yes.

### Why CC0?
I think forcing someone to give credits for crappy artworks is just kinda stupid. Of course, I would license a decent one with other Creative Commons licenses.
